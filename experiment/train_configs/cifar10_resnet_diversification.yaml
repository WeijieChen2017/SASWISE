# Training configuration for CIFAR10 ResNet with diversification
experiment_name: CIFAR10_ResNet
model_type: resnet50
dataset: cifar10

# Training parameters
training:
  # Number of rounds to perform (each round draws two new menus)
  # This is equivalent to n_draw in the diversification process
  num_rounds: 100
  
  # Number of epochs to train each menu configuration within a round
  # This is equivalent to epochs_per_draw in the diversification process
  epochs_per_round: 10
  
  # Weight of consistency loss relative to accuracy loss
  # Higher values prioritize consistency between different menu configurations
  # This is equivalent to alpha_consistency_to_accuracy
  alpha: 0.3
